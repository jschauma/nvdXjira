NAME
     nvdXjira -- cross-reference CVEs from the NVD with Jira

SYNOPSIS
     nvdXjira [-Dhlnv] [-c file] [-d dbfile] [-j url] [-o format] [-p project]
	      [-r file] [-t tag]

DESCRIPTION
     The nvdXjira utility cross-references CVEs found in a local sqlite3 copy
     of NIST's National Vulerability Database with a Jira instance.  That is,
     for every CVE found in the database, it will look for tickets containing
     the CVE identifier anywhere in the text.  For any CVEs not found in Jira,
     nvdXjira can create a new ticket.

OPTIONS
     nvdXjira supports the following options:

     -D		 Run in debug mode.  No tickets will be created.

     -c file	 Read configuration from this file.

     -d dbfile	 Read input from the given database file.

     -h		 Print a short usage statement and exit.

     -j url	 Specify the base URL for Jira.

     -l		 List Jira tickets with their respective CVEs.	This is the
		 default mode.

     -n		 Create new tickets for CVEs not found in Jira.

     -o format	 Specify output format.	 May be 'list' (default) or 'details'.

     -p project	 If -n was specified, create new tickets in this project.

     -r file	 Read regular expressions from this file and immediately close
		 any tickets where the body matches.

     -t tag	 If -n was specified, tag new tickets with this tag/label.

     -v		 Be verbose.  Can be specified multiple times.

DETAILS
     nvdXjira operates on an sqlite3 copy of NIST's National Vulnerability
     Database, created using the nvd2sqlite3(1) utility.  It will loop over
     all entries in the database, and, for each CVE found, query Jira for any
     tickets containing the CVE identifier in its text, and either print the
     ticket to CVE mappings (default) or create a new ticket for the CVE.

     New tickets are, by default, created under the 'VULN' project, and tagged
     with the 'cve' label.

CONFIGURATION
     By default, nvdXjira reads its configuration from the file /etc/nvdXjira
     (if it exists).  In this file, you can specify the following key-
     word=value pairs:

     database	The pathname of the database to read input from.  Overwrite
		using the -d flag.  Defaults to /var/db/cvedb/nvd.db.

     password	The password with which to authenticate against the Jira API.
		Overwrite using the NVDXJIRA_PASSWORD environment variable.
		No default value.

     project	The Jira project under which to create new tickets.  Overwrite
		using the -p flag.  Defaults to 'VULN'.

     reject	The pathname of a file containing regular expressions based on
		which to immediately close any tickets with a matching
		description.  No default value.

     url	The base URL for Jira API access.  Overwrite using the -u
		flag.  No default value.

     username	The username to authenticate as against the Jira API.  Over-
		write using the NVDXJIRA_USER environment variable.  Defaults
		to USER.

     tag	The tag with which to label newly created tickets.  Overwrite
		using the -n flag.  Defaults to 'cve'.

EXAMPLES
     To list all tickets for all CVEs in the database '/var/db/nvd.db'

	   nvdXjira -d /var/db/nvd.db

     To create new tickets for any CVEs found in the database but not yet in
     Jira, using the 'security' project and tagging each ticket using the
     'nvd' label:

	   nvdXjira -n -d /var/db/cve.db -p security -t nvd

EXIT STATUS
     The nvdXjira utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
